Development Box
---------------
If you do not feel comfortable with setting up the application and its environment then 
as a quick start you can use our [LearnZF2 dev box](https://github.com/slaff/learnzf2-box) which is using Vagrant and VirtualBox.
If you want to experiment with Zend Framework 2 and the upcoming PHP7 you can also use the LearnZF2 VM as described [here](https://github.com/slaff/learnzf2-box#php7).

Application
-----------
The final version of the source code comes with ready to test Zend Framework 2 web
application with prefilled SQLite database.

The steps below are needed if you don't use the LearnZF2 dev box. 
But we would strongly encourage you to take a look at these steps and understand their meaning.

### Preparation ###

In order to get the dependant packages, like Zend Framework 2 for example, we have to 
run the following commands once in the beginning.  

```
cd learnzf2/
./composer.phar self-update
./composer.phar install
```

### Run from PHP built-in server
The easiest way to run the code, if you have PHP 5.4 or newer is to type:
```
cd learnzf2/
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public/
```

And then open in your browser the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/

### Run from separate web server
In order to use the application with via separate web server(Apache, NGINX, etc) make sure that:

The data/db/tc.sqlite file is readable from the web server user.
The following commands can help you set the group to www-data and adjust the permissions.
```
chgrp www-data -R data/db
chmod g+rx data/db
chmod g+w data/db/tc.sqlite
```

1. Admin user with email: admin@learnzf2.com and password admin123
